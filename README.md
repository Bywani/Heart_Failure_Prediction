# Heart Matters - Heart Failure Prediction

<hr style="border: 2px solid black;">

Heart Failure, also known as congestive heart failure, is a debilitating condition that affects millions of individuals worldwide. It is characterized by the inability of the heart to pump enough blood to meet the body's needs for oxygen and nutrients. This can lead to a range of symptoms such as fatigue, shortness of breath, and edema. It is a progressive condition that requires ongoing medical management and can greatly impact an individual's quality of life.

**Business Problem:**
Heart failure poses a significant financial burden on healthcare systems, as well as a tremendous toll on patients and their families. Despite advances in medical treatments, the rate of hospitalization and readmission for heart failure remains alarmingly high. The cost of healthcare for heart failure patients continues to rise, making it imperative to find ways to improve the early detection and management of this condition.

**Project Objective:**
The objective of this project is to build a predictive model to accurately identify individuals at risk of heart failure. By leveraging the power of machine learning and XAI techniques, this project aims to improve the early detection and management of heart failure, reducing the incidence of hospitalization and readmission, and ultimately improving the lives of those affected by this condition.

**Dataset:**
The dataset used in this project was obtained from Kaggle (https://www.kaggle.com/code/sourabhpatil2628/prediction-on-heart-diesease/data). This dataset contains a variety of demographic, lifestyle, and medical information on patients with heart failure, providing a rich source of data for building a predictive model. The use of this dataset is for educational purposes only and will provide a valuable opportunity for increasing my machine learning and XAI skills.
